# Analog Clock

This project is a simple analog clock application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed to be served using Nginx in a Docker container.

## Features

- Displays a real-time analog clock.
- Responsive design that works on various screen sizes.
- Easy to deploy using Docker.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Docker
- Nginx

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ziyad-tarek1/Docker_The_Hard_Way
   cd Docker_The_Hard_Way/analog_clock
   ```

2. Ensure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your machine.

## Running the Application

### Using Docker

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t analog_clock .
   ```

2. Run the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8080:80 analog_clock
   ```

3. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to view the analog clock.

### Without Docker

If you prefer to run the application without Docker, you can simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. However, using Docker is recommended for a consistent environment.

## Docker Commands

- **Build the Docker image**:
  ```bash
  docker build -t analog_clock .
  ```

- **Run the Docker container**:
  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 8080:80 analog_clock
  ```

- **Stop the Docker container**:
  ```bash
  docker ps  # Get the container ID
  docker stop <container_id>
  ```

- **Remove the Docker container**:
  ```bash
  docker rm <container_id>
  ```

## Health Check

The Docker container includes a health check that verifies if the Nginx server is running. It checks the root URL every 30 seconds. If the server is not responding, the container will be marked as unhealthy.
